# Slim Controller implementation

Example of how a controller interface could be implemented into Slim.

SlimC.php is an extension of the Slim class with an added function for assigning controllers to routes. It also includes the abstract base Controller class.

index.php shows how to set it in action.

The controller.namespace config setting is optional.
